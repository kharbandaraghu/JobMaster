## Description

___
## Installation and Prerequisites
Before getting started with the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

### 1. Python and Virtual Environment
Install Python if you haven't already. You can download it from the official Python website: python.org.
It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment for the project to keep the dependencies isolated. You can create a virtual environment using the following command:

```python3
python3 -m venv myenv
```

### 2. Activate the virtual environment:
For Windows:

```python3
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
For MacOS/Linux:
```python3
source myenv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Required Packages
Install the required packages by running the following command:

```python3
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root directory and include the following variables:
```bash
  VARIABLE_NAME=description
```
Replace VARIABLE_NAME with the actual name of the variable and description with a brief description of its purpose.

### 5. Resume
Put your resume as Resume.pdf in the project root directory.

### 6. Database
The database used in the project is called "JobMaster" and can be viewed using a tool like DB Browser for SQLite. Please note that the database file will not be committed to GitHub.
Once you have completed the above prerequisites, you are ready to proceed with running the project.

Feel free to modify this section based on your specific requirements and provide any additional instructions or prerequisites if necessary.
