    Hello '+currentname+',<br>\
    I hope you had an awesome New Year and a great day so far!<br>\
    <br>\
    I wanted to inquire about any open full-time new grad positions in '+mytext+' at '+currentCompany+' starting in May. I saw your profile on LinkedIn and wanted to reach out to you. Here\'s what I bring to the table to add value to the organization.<br>\
    <br>\
    <b>Experience:</b> My program, focuses mostly on chemical systems and material science. However, I have developed in-depth knowledge of programming concepts and data structures by teaching myself and by working in the relevant industries during my co-ops because I have a passion for coding.<br>\
    <b>Leadership:</b> I have attended and won many hackathons where I have experienced teamwork and team building activities while working on a common goal and solving challenging problems which have helped me gain diverse experience over widespread fields.<br>\
    <b>Lifelong Learning:</b> I strive to continuously learn new technologies and develop skills to deliver higher performance at workplace.<br>\
    <br>\
    Thank you once again for your help. I have also attached my rÃ©sumÃ© for your reference. Have a great rest of the day and week ðŸ˜Š<br>\
    <br>\
    Best<br>\
